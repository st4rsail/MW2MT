<h1>Salvage</h1>

<img src="../images/thumbnails/salvage.png" />

<p>Place: 14 miles SSE of Petropavlovsk, Russia<br />
Teams: Task Force 141 and Spetsnaz<br />
Terrain: Snowy</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>It can be described as a snowy junkyard fortified by stacked debris and crushed cars.[1]The junkyard setting provides plenty of cover in the form of crushed vehicles and debris, yet is very open in some areas. It appears to be based on the same section of the singleplayer level Contingency  that was used for the Special Ops level Sniper Fi.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>The map features a prominent building, known to some as the Zakhaev  house. This building is popular for players to camp  in, due to the many simple ways of defending it. However, eventually enemies will use launchers or other means to flush players out. The walls are easily penetrable without FMJ in this building, and in all other buildings throughout the map, so this is something to consider when trying to combat people who are window camping. </p>

<p>A great place to counter-snipe enemies on the second floor of the Zahkaev house is to position yourself inside the bush close to the Task Force 141 spawn. Having an arctic Ghillie and cold-blooded pro makes you very difficult to spot from afar. </p>

<p>Due to the small size of the map, and its narrow corridors and tight corners, many players decide to shotgun-run. However some players will still camp, as there are several areas with good sightlines. The roof of the Zakhaev house is accessable, and can be a useful place for snipers, for a limited time due to revenge killing. </p>

<p>In Search and Destroy, "A" is incredibly easy to defend; the defending team's spawn is at "A", and moving towards "B", players can position themselves on top of a dumpster and watch across the area where attackers moving towards A have to cross. "B" is usually mortared by grenades at the start, as it is simple to rush to the right from the attack spawn. "B" is also easily rush-planted by these players, unless the defenders have players positioned on the pile of cars in the middle. </p>

<p>In Capture the Flag, as stated before, the Zakhaev House flag is easily guarded. Claymores and high powered weapons such as LMGs can help with defending. There is a broken car lift with barrels on it, which provides a good vantage point if attacking the Zakhaev building. </p>

<p>The "C" Flag in Domination is very easy to defend, and therefore difficult to regain if lost. Claymores or C4 can help defend it, as can putting a Tactical Insertion nearby.</p>

<p>Submachine Guns and Assault Rifles are very useful on this map, due to the close quarters areas, and the sometimes medium-long range fighting. Shotguns excel in the tight alleyways. Sniper Rifles are less useful, but can be used well on the rooftop, and in the windows in the building near Search and Destroy objective A. </p>

<p>The Javelin is extremely deadly on this map, particularly the center alley, which is often used as a camping spot. </p>

<p>The map features a doghouse in which players can crawl inside. It is ultimately a bad position, as once one player has been killed by someone in there, they will likely just shoot through it with little problem to kill the player. However, some players in Search and Destroy completely fill the doghouse with Riot Shields and stay there until the enemy finds them, just for novelty. </p>

<p>An easy way to get kills is to cause the fuel tanks to explode, most easily done with a launcher or semtex.</p>
