<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Trailer Park is a new map found in the Resurgence Pack DLC in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The map is centered around a mobile home park. The map size is small with tight corridors and run-n-gun type combat. It is reported that set in context of the game, this is the living quarters of the people who run U.S. Vehicle Disposal Yard 437, which is visible in the background. This is the smallest map in the Resurgence Package and one of the most intense for short range combat with plenty of places for players to camp.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>This is an ideal map to score FMJ penetration kills to earn Extended Magazines as nearly all of the buildings and fences are very light cover with many gaps to see through. Offering many opportunities for easy penetration kills.</p>

<p>Stay where the plane is. No-one seems to go there and the caravan near one of the planes is a brilliant spot on Capture the Flag.</p>

<p>Snipers work best near the roadblock. Go down the path a bit and you can snipe like on Wasteland. Note that you may die easily, but if you stay against the small bit of fence your view will be limited, but it'll be harder to get killed.</p>
