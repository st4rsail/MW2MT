<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Vacant is a small map that is set in an abandoned office building. The main building contains various pieces of office equipment, cubicles, and random debris lying around. Attached to the main building is a warehouse, which connects to the main office area. Outside one can find multiple destroyed vehicles, abandoned shipping containers, and a large oil tank. The map plays host to intense close quarter battles, due to most of the map being indoors, with the outdoor areas usually serving as flanking positions. Also at the each corner of the map, there are overviews of the city.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Since most of the map is close quarters combat, shotguns and SMGs are generally favoured, but LMGs and Assault rifles can prove useful in the outdoor sections of the map.</p>

<p>A well thrown grenade can take out multiple enemies, due to the closeness of the hallways and the lack of area to escape to. A RPG-7 or Grenade Launcher could be used just as effectively.</p>

<p>Woodland Camouflage and Digital Camouflage are the most useful, but Blue Tiger Camouflage can work decently as well.</p>

<p>Despite airstrikes seeming near useless, a well placed airstrike can still kill, as there are holes in the roof of the building, most notably the warehouse.</p>
