<h1>Sub Base</h1>

<img src="../images/thumbnails/sub_base.png" />

<p>Place: 14 miles SSE of Petropavlovsk, Russia<br />
Teams: Navy SEALs vs. Spetsnaz<br />
Type of Combat: Short to medium range combat<br />
Terrain: Flat, concrete, multiple multi-level buildings</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Sub Base is a snowy, multi-leveled map, with many large open spaces as well as enclosed buildings and exposed rooftops.</p>

<p>Amid the buildings is a large courtyard-styled area in the middle of the map. Many routes on the map flow into this area, making it a highly-contested area for gunfights. Players on the catwalks fight against enemies approaching through a tunnel as well as an adjacent rooftop. A large warehouse at one end is used for long-range firefights whereas at the other end, the power station is home to close-quarter battles.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>A good S&amp;D tactics when the player feels that planting the bomb is needed (Such as when only a few players on the other team) is to get to the walkway over the submarine and jumping onto the ledges. This is especially good with suppressed weapons and Cold-Blooded since the death skull will attract other players while not giving your position away from gun fire or an enemy UAV.</p>

<p>In the two killing-based game modes, Team Deathmatch and Free for All, the dock area to the east of the map is generally the area where most players contest. There is an abundance of cover in which snipers can use to their advantage, as well as areas where assault rifles will overturn enemies quickly. Flanking is extremely common as players begin to get frustrated at being constantly killed in the same area, so in TDM it is advisable to have an individual watching the back of the team. The courtyard plays host to more intense battles in Domination, as the controlling B flag is situated in the loading bay. It is advisable to rush straight to this flag at the beginning in order to capture it before the enemy as it is very difficult to take over unless powerful air support is laying waste to enemies. Controlling just two flags, with B being a necessity, helps greatly in this game mode as knowing where enemies are spawning can help in attaining killstreaks, or simply killing them to stop them taking over other flags. The Control Room and Maintenance yard area is where many players tend to call in Care Packages or Emergency Airdrops, as little fighting occurs in the area as well as the abundance of open space. However, experienced players know of this and are likely to check this area as soon as they hear their announcer state the airdrop incoming.</p>

<p>Airstrikes are very effective on Sub Base, something not seen with other maps. The dock area to the East usually has a large number of enemies located within it, so well-placed Stealth Bombers and Precision Airstrikes can potentially kill all of the enemy team, especially if they are spawn-trapped at the A flag, or on attack on Demolition. AC-130s and Chopper Gunners are less useful as there is a large amount of cover and several buildings. Pave Lows can decimate teams if they spawn outside, as well as Harriers. UAVs are less useful on this map than others, as there are many levels which enemies can be on.</p>

<p>Long-range Assault Rifles are usually the most effective weapons to use. There are more long-range encounters than close range, so powerful rifles such as the M16A4 and SCAR-H are usually preferred over weaker SMGs such as the P90. Sniper Rifles can be effective to an extent but are limited in the fact that they perform poorly in close quarters where flanking players are likely to appear. The Riot shield, coupled with Cold-Blooded and a Blast Shield, used with a Smoke Grenade, can be critical for securing objectives such as at the start of Domination in attaining the B flag.</p>
