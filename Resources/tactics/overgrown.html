<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Overgrown is a wide, open map with plenty of vegetation and cover spots. The map has three distinct sections: a farm located on the northern half of the map containing a large barn and two fields that provide cover and concealment. A curved street lined with buildings on the southern half of the map, and running horizontally through the middle of the map is a river bed with two bridges on the east and western sides of the map crossing over it. Just north of the river bed in the middle of the map is a two-story farm house (with a mounted M249 on the second floor, or a mini-gun in Modern Warfare 2) that is accessible from the all the sections of the map.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>When on Team Deathmatch, if an enemy helicopter is called out to the match the player can use the mounted M249 SAWs in the houses to take it down. Many players have used this method and have taken down the helicopter in seconds. </p>

<p>When sniping, if the player spawns by the building with open windows, go around the back towards the ravine. There is a small box that the player can snipe behind which gives a good view of the other team's spawn.</p>

<p>The player can plant C4 on the helicopter when it hovers about seven feet above the wheat field. </p>

<p>At "Grandma's House", watch out for C4 at the doors and staircase. Also, if sniping from it, don't stay for long. Players will often check the building for snipers and there is a ladder which is often overlooked at the side facing the barn.</p>
<p>Any airstrikes work best in the riverbed, when the enemy moves across it becoming sitting ducks. </p>

<p>Snipers will often camp in the grass, so watch for any movement. Thermal scopes can show uncloaked ones, while the Cold-Blooded ones will be a bit more challenging to root out. </p>

<p>The dry riverbed at the middle of the map is a great place to snipe the buildings on it, especially the ruined building near the wooden bridge. </p>

<p>There is a way to jump on the ledges in the dry riverbed and go directly into the ruined building, this is good for surprising snipers. </p>

<p>At the start of Team Deathmatch use a sniper at the end of either bridge and pick off anyone who tries to cross the other bridge. Be careful, once a kill is achieved, move. Enemy snipers may be trying something similar.</p>

<p>Snipers can use the Spetnaz spawn point's house as cover to snipe across the bridge. This is especially useful while trying to hold the bridge area.</p>

<p>At the large house near TF141's spawn, a player can climb up onto the normally unaccessible part of the second floor. By climbing onto the centermost protrusion of the destroyed wall and jumping to the remnants of the second floor a player would have a superior sniping spot, being able to see over the hay field. THe lethality of the sniper can be increased by using a Tactical Insertion to consistently spawn on the second floor.</p>
