<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Wasteland is set in the wilderness somewhere near the Chernobyl Nuclear plant. It contains some elements from the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare  level All Ghillied Up, and features radioactive zones around the perimeter. A large, multi-entrance bunker sits in the middle, and once a team is settled in, it is tricky to root them out. A large hedge sprawls over the center of the map. Many trenches criss-cross the map, complete with heavy-duty manual sentry guns. A few buildings, low walls and a helipad are scattered around the edges but seldom see any notable combat. The map has a similar layout to the Call of Duty 2 multiplayer map Brecourt .</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>Despite being a perfect sniping map, many people also like to camp in the bunker. Anything that makes players stealthier is ideal such as going prone or using a silenced weapon. Thermal scopes and Cold-Blooded are both essential for rooting out snipers although it can be hard to find those that are prone, due to the undulating nature of the map. A sniper wearing a ghillie suit is practically invisible if they are prone. Smoke grenades will have some benefit when crossing open ground, except most snipers on this map prefer to use thermal sights to spot enemy ghillie snipers. This makes Cold Blooded effective; because of the grey-tone nature of the map, the player is practically invisible even when sprinting in the open if someone is using a Thermal scope, and especially while running through smoke.</p>

<h2>The Bunker</h2>

<p>The bunker can be quite troublesome to control as there are many entrances. Grenade launchers work wonders in this area as well as Semtex  and Claymores, as do grenades due to their tendency to roll to the lowest point. Also, RPGs are useful for clearing bunkers when used with Scavenger and Danger Close. Placing a Sentry Gun at the back of a wall can assume control of multiple of entrances. One technique is to let the other team take control of the cave, and then firing an RPG-7 or AT4 into the cave. This is advisable with Danger Close and Scavenger, and is an easy way to get multi-kills.</p>

<p>In the bunker it is very useful to have a Blast Shield almost always on, as it is usually obvious where the enemies are, and it is common for a lot of explosives to be used in storming the bunker, but it wouldn't protect you from flashbangs. This is always a switch off, losing offensive power to gain defensive power. If the player is using Blast Shield, they will be at a severe disadvantage if they assault the bunker.</p>

<p>When the bunker becomes the war zone, it helps a lot to flank the enemy, especially if your team mates are maintaining and taking control of it, and the enemy charges on one entrance.</p>

<p>With proper coordination and skill, players with air support kill streaks can encourage the enemy to herd into the bunker, allowing teammates to get multikills with grenade launcher, RPGs, Thumpers or AT4s. Also within the bunker, there is a small crack that gives a view from the other side, it is big enough to just squeeze a grenade, but small enough to keep the player safe from most fire without FMJ.</p>

<h2>Commanding Killstreaks</h2>

<p>The houses and bushes offer perfect hiding spots to control killstreaks. It is advisable to not cross open ground without moving slowly or hugging the hedgeline, as snipers tend to aim for easy targets instead of those partially concealed. Air support can decimate a team on this open map, especially AC-130s  so it is advised to take them out fast.</p>

<p>Almost every killstreak is effective here, with that being said, Emergency Airdrops, Sentry Guns, Chopper Gunners, AC-130s and Care Packages work better here than almost any other map, thanks to its open nature. If an enemy gets a Chopper Gunner or AC-130, try to take it out or get inside. These killstreaks are extremely deadly here since there is virtually no cover from above except for the bunker and the houses, but the AC-130's 105mm cannon can kill almost anyone in there as well. The miniguns can be a good alternative to taking down killstreaks, just make sure the player is using Cold-Blooded, though continuous fire leaves the gunner susceptible to sniper fire or even by another minigun, and they are not as effective as their M240 mounted counterparts in CoD4 (which destroy helicopters in around 5 seconds) and the Stinger.</p>

<p>The Stealth Bomber can devastate an enormous portion of the map, try setting the direction length-wise ,or sometimes a diagonal path, through the map.</p>

<h2>Mini-guns</h2>

<p>The mini-guns scattered around the map offer many opportunities to gain a significant advantage over an enemy team. For example:</p>

<p>1. They can be used to easily take down enemy killstreaks (Be sure to have Cold-Blooded equipped).</p>
<p>2. They can be used for suppressive fire to keep snipers down while teammates take them out. </p>

<p>There is a mini-gun within the broken cars on a jersey barrier. While the turret itself is helpful, the surrounding cars and rusting metal provides great cover for snipers, and the cracks between the metal and cars can be used to take out enemies if they are within view. It has a view of the chopper and the fence area near it and can be used with great ease.</p>

<p>Another turret is located by the broken church; however, it is open to half the map and invites sniper fire. There are also two turrets in the middle left side of the map when playing Domination at point Bravo. They are very useful while playing Domination, but players can be easily spotted by snipers.</p>

<h2>Sniping</h2>

<p>There are many great sniping locations within this map, one of the most elusive is the helicopter in the bottom left of the map, if the player jumps on the front nose, then jumps left on to the exhaust, then jumps onto the cockpit, the player can then get on top of the rotor blades or to the top of the tail. Although be careful when sniping from this position, as any other sniper on that half of the map has a line of sight on that position.</p>

<p>Bling Pro can be very useful on this map combined with Cold-Blooded Pro and Ninja, giving the player the ability to use a silenced sniper rifle with a thermal scope and a good silenced sidearm, like the PP2000 or the G18 with another attachment like a Red Dot Sight or Akimbo. With the Ghillie Suit, [Thermal Scope|Thermal Scope]], Cold-Blooded Pro, Ninja and the silencers equipped, the player will be very difficult to detect, while the thermal scope will give away enemy snipers' positions.</p>

<p>On the outskirts, it has been known that it is possible to place a Tactical Insertion halfway or more, into the Radioactive area. Once the player dies, he/she will re-spawn and continue from there, past the radioactive area, to a safe area to snipe from.</p>

<p>Sniper rifles, particularly the Barrett .50 Cal and the WA2000, can be used very successfully inside the bunker. By going prone inside, the player can easily pick off numerous enemies as they enter the bunker from the east.</p>
