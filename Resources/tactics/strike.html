<p>Place: An urban desert town; location unknown<br />
Teams: US Army Rangers vs. OpFor<br />
Type of Combat: Medium range to close quarters combat with some long range fighting<br />
Terrain: Urban desert town with many streets and enterable buildings</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Stike is a very urban map with the largest open space being the two roads that run through the map. There are many small building that see little combat, although a good sniper can own a large area of the map while being safely planted inside one. Light Machine Guns are favored here.</p>

<p>"Taliban Avenue" and "Al-Qaeda Road", the two main intersecting streets (in the middle of the map creating a "T", below the marketplace) are where the most choke points for snipers and Assault classes are located. The apartment block to the south provides sniper points covering nearly the entire map. But beware of the Al-Jazeera towers to the West, they provide a blind corner for rushers. There are long lines of view, and most fighting occurs building-to-building across the streets. People tend to enjoy this map most with Team Deathmatch or Headquarters settings. Desert Camouflage is often preferred.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Sniping is very effective in the apartment at the top right corner of the map, on account of the overview of the intersections, good cover, and the exits can be covered by claymores. The use of claymores can also get kills if positioned properly. The corners are sharp, so no one sees them.</p>

<p>It is possible on Domination to hide in the far back corner on the bottom floor of the building closest to flag C and take it without being spotted/attacked. It has been stated by Robert Bowling that this is not possible in the Modern Warfare 2 version of the map.</p>

<p>The walled in area near the Marine spawn can be used to snipe and secretly kill someone in the building across the street.</p>

<p>Low recoil and/or high power weapons are recommended for this map, due to most of the combat occurring in the streets or at long ranges.</p>
