<p>Place: London, United Kingdom<br />
Teams: Task Force 141 vs. Spetsnaz<br />
Terrain: Warehouse</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Storm is a new map included in the Stimulus Package for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It is described as "an open industrial park littered with heavy machinery." Like its name says, outside of the warehouse is a heavy storm. Storm looks slightly like the maps Killhouse and Vacant from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Storm is a very unpredictable map, having many choke points where it is easy to be flanked. Weapons like the UMP45, ACR, SCAR-H, M4A1, Intervention, P90, and MP5K are common and effective on this map.</p>

<p>When on the warehouse floor there are little overhangs which the player can hide under that will provide cover from any fire coming from the catwalks. </p>

<p>In the construction yard, there are deep holes in which the player can hide in when prone. </p>

<p>The roof of the mannequin store provides a great view of the map. </p>

<p>Maintaining a presence in the multi-story buildings across the map can prove to be invaluable as it provides long sight lines covering large portions of the map, whereas the ground level is littered with cover, thus obscuring a player's view.</p>

<p>In Search and Destroy, Ninja Pro is a very useful perk since most of the surfaces in the warehouse and near the bomb sites are metal and makes the players footsteps very loud. </p>

<p>Conversely, SitRep Pro will make enemy footsteps impossible to ignore. </p>

<p>Grenade launchers can fly over some obstructions, killing the enemy without exposing the position of one using the grenade launcher. </p>

<p>In every building, there is more than one way to the top floor. Plant claymores at one and occasionally check the other entry to ensure of no flankers. </p>

<p>It is actually very easy to go from the Spetsnaz spawn point to point A in Domination before the Task Force 141 troops can get there if the player has Marathon, Lightweight, and any third perk. This can easily kill most of the enemies there, and actually enable the player to gain an edge in the map. </p>

<p>There are many piles of wood which can be seen and shot through, thus giving slight cover and the element of surprise when an enemy comes into sight.</p>

<p>When playing domination, it is a good idea to take control of the building overlooking the A flag because it gives you long sight lines in two directions that are common for enemies to go by.</p>
