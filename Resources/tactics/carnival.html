<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Carnival is a map found in the Resurgence Pack DLC (Released June 3, 2010 for the Xbox 360). The map is centered around an abandoned amusement park, located most likely in Brazil (noting the factions are TF-141 vs Militia). It includes various attractions such as a roller coaster and fun house. Infinity Ward  claims that this map is quite large with long sightlines. This map has a daytime setting. There are multiple areas in the map that are all inter-connected, such as the FunHouse, "The World of Tomorrow" (full of spaceships), medieval themed bumper cars, the ground beneath a roller coaster, and various food vendors.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>In Capture The Flag as Task Force 141, it is a good idea to use the Fun House to spawn trap the enemy. They will generally spawn by the space ship. But be careful, they may go into the back entrance of the Fun House to kill the player, so its a good idea to use claymores. </p>

<p>The fun house offers a great sniping spot, but it can be accessed from many sides, so it is difficult to hold it down with just one person. Also, snipers at the castle can easily countersnipe a careless sniper in the fun house. Also any sniper in the castle can be taken out by a sniper in the rocket ship, and any sniper in the rocket ship can easily be shot by a player on the ground below him.</p>

<p>The Militia spawn has many nooks and crannies, perfect for ambushes. If the player is with the Task Force, it is advised cutting right and storming the Fun House to eliminate snipers and hopefully take the Fun House. Otherwise, it is better to fight defensively and make the Militia take the fight to you, where you can set up your own ambushes.</p>

<p>UAV's are good for exposing opponents, as ambushes are extremely common on this map.</p>

<p>Players with Marathon can easily surprise enemies camping from behind, rushing is a good strategy, but avoid getting caught and if you are caught, escape as soon as possible, try to lure your enemy into a trap.</p>

<p>When sniping, alter locations between the fun house and another sniper perch like the Dragon's Den or the Rocket Ship, that way you can kill a player and kill them again when they respawn and go to check where you were.</p>

<p>Take a few shots at the rocket ship to see if anyone is present. It's so dark a sniper can hide without being seen. Use a thermal sight to help you.</p>
