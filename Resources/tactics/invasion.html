<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Invasion is set in Afghanistan and based off of the second campaign mission. It's similar to the map Crash in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, featuring many elevated positions, close range fighting, and cover. Invasion is actually based off the area that Pelayo  crashes in Shock and Awe in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. On the eastern side of the map, the street is exactly the one same as the one that Jackson walked down to retrieve Pelayo from the helicopter.</p>

<p>This is an excellent map for car bombing other players, as C4 can be hidden under the many Humvees on the bridge and in the city. There are a total of nine Humvees but only seven can be blown up as the two near the left side of the base are invincible. On Search and Destroy gamemodes players can immediately shoot at the enemy spawn with grenade launchers. This is especially devastating on hardcore.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Invasion combines hectic close combat and precision sniping in one map. This is one of the more predictable maps and predictability is key to winning here. Although assault rifles are common, submachine guns work as well in the alleyways. SMGs like the UMP45, MP5K and Vector are common and effective on this map.</p>

<p>The inner side of the map has two great sniping spots that overlook the alleyway in front of the bar and bookstore and the street. Both towers have two ways in, check both ways often to ensure nobody attempts to sneak from behind.</p>

<p>The embassy at the back of the map is rarely used in online play making it excellent for sniping people in the courtyard. This is also a nice place to call in airdrops, although the rarely traversed Humvees nearby work even better. It is also quite easy to flank careless players in the embassy, especially when they are calling in airdrops.</p>

<p>The blue destroyed building has an alternate vantage point from that of the balcony building, thus allowing it to take potshots on the video store, cover the balcony or even camp A flag.</p>

<p>It can be hard to maintain control of the center and alleyways, due to so many doors, it is very easy to get flanked and ambushed. </p>

<p>Sniping can be one of the players greatest advantages, or their greatest foe, it would help to have a sniper or another player providing cover fire.</p>

<p>The bookstore has many campers, particularly behind the shelves and the dead end in the back. Angle a semtex so it sails into their hiding spots and flushes them out. Rushing also works well.</p>

<p>Be careful with the Predator Missile, it can hit a light post or the side of the building and not even touch anyone. You don't have to accelerate the missile once it comes online.</p>

<p>Riot Shielders can get a lot of attention when pushing forward. Since most people focus on the shield, teammates can easily flank the distracted players.</p>

<p>There are many depressions especially on the ocean side, going prone can provide cover from an attacker, but the player can easily be killed by a well placed grenade.</p>

<p>A well thrown grenade can flush out potential ambushes in the tight areas in the buildings.</p>

<p>A good starter tactic on the Rangers side is to run to the ocean side and scope in to catch Opfor players sprinting for easy sniper kills. There is a sandbag that provides good cover from most gunfire that one can crouch behind. Another good piece of cover is the corner of the building that extends outdoors.</p>

<p>The buildings on this map are numerous and typically only have two ways in or out, this would allow for easy target loss by moving quickly between the buildings.</p>

<p>The counters in the bar and bookstore can conceal someone crouching. Easy stealth tactic.</p>

<p>Near the gas station in the map there is a broken tank. Crouch under the treads (wheels) of the tank and the player can see right through it and shoot down the alley.</p>
