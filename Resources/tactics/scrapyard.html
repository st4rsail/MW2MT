<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Scrapyard is an airplane scrapyard with many airplane parts scattered around. It is a moderately linear map, similar to Highrise  in some aspects, but is much smaller. Game modes such as Ground War Domination and Hardcore Headquarters are highly chaotic; the size of the map combined with a high number of players or highly-damaging weapons means there is constant action.</p>

<p>The plane carcasses offer limited cover, and provide camping areas for players, however constantly killing enemies from inside the planes cause enemies to begin to use explosives or use FMJ to shoot through the weak metal walls, for a revenge kill. Spawn Trapping is ultimately useless, unless with an experienced full team of 6 or 9 players, as the map is very small, and players moving into spawns is very common.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

 <p>Given that most of the map is close-quarters, many players tend to use SMGs, however, at times combat is at longer ranges where these players find themselves outclassed by Assault Rifle users. Sniping is definitely a tactic to be avoided; given the quick spawn changes and high-powered weapons found in Modern Warfare 2, a sniper is at a huge disadvantage. The map also does not feature any decent sightlines where sniping is useful. However, many players like to camp atop the gantry in Warehouse 3, and snipe from there. However after one or two kills their position is more than likely given away, and enemies killed by a sniper here will likely try for a revenge kill either from below or from an explosive. If the enemy spawn is predictable, camping in an airplane body such as the one to the east of the blue plane, and looking down to the Power station and office area, a user of an assault rifle can rack up quick killstreaks. FMJ is one of the best attachments as every surface enemies can hide behind are easily penetrable.</p>

<p>Because of the random spawning, players camping can easily be flanked. However, staying and patrolling one area can be particularly effective, for example the offices in the game mode Free For All. It is incredibly risky to walk into the middle of the map, and will almost certainly cause a quick death. Staying around the perimeter is generally advisable for most game modes, especially TDM for flanking.</p>

<p>Although it may seem less obvious, using UAVs on Scrapyard is wise as it gives a good idea to the team where the enemies are spawning, as it is usually very random. Predator Missiles or Airstrikes can take out large groups of enemies, as well as the Stealth Bomber, which can potentially wipe out an entire team if placed correctly. The Chopper Gunner is always useful, but is bad if short on time as it takes a long period of time to reach the map.</p>

<h2>Secret Areas</h2>

<p>There are two main "secret" areas, commonly known as glitches (even thought they aren't), on Scrapyard.</p>

<p>The player is able to get on top of the 3 planes in the middle of the map from accessing the broken wing and climbing up and then jumping to the top. This can be used for some very quick kills but it would be advisable to not stay up there for awhile unless the player has a supportive team. Also, the player can get on top of the tail end of the plane by jumping up using the open windows. This is also an excellent place to set up a Sentry Gun.</p>

<p>At Bomb Objective A, players can climb over several boxes, and by strafe-jumping can easily get onto a higher vantage point of which to look over the objective.</p>
