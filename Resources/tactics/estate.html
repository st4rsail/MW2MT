<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Estate map contains a large house on a hill and some of the surrounding property in a lightly forested setting.</p>

<p>Expect long range combat along with close quarters combat near and in the houses on the map. It is influenced by the Special Ops level Estate Takedown and the singleplayer level Loose Ends. The map has a triangular layout for Domination  games instead of actual sides for the factions. It is contested by Task Force 141 and the Spetsnaz. Estate is set on an estate grounds with terrain similar to the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare  multiplayer maps Creek and Overgrown.</p>
<p>The Map of Estate.</p>

<p>Estate is a good sniping map. When using a ghillie suit lying down in the grass you are almost impossible to spot. However, in the actual estate building, heavy close quarters combat is usual, and shotguns dominate here. Sometimes even usual Team Deathmatches in Estate will quickly turn into something like sieges, where one team is fortified in the estate, and the other team tries to storm it. This may continue through the whole match, and the attackers may become defenders and vice versa many times in a match.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>If you jump up from the couch to the wooden beam above the window and turn 135 degrees to your right, jump on to the thin ledge. This is a great spot for Domination as you can kill players trying to defend A, or you can defend A yourself.</p>

<p>The best place to take control of the main house area is in the basement, if someone were above you throw a stun grenade and shoot him. This is also a good spot because every player passes by the cars to go in the house.</p>

<p>If the player is looking to maintain control of the house, a good place for tactical insertion is inside the bathroom (the en suite in the bedroom as opposed to the one on the landing) as well as placing it on the bench in the basement, under the staircase.</p>

<p>Another good area to camp is by the wall to the left of the 1st to 2nd floor staircase, in the suite. It is recommended to have a close range/long range combo of weaponry such as a Intervention with a Thermal Scope and a SPAS-12, as this will allow a player to operate from both the windows and the interior.</p>

<p>A knife wielder with Commando can be effective inside the house.</p>

<p>On the top floor, jump toward the couch and jump/climb to the roof beam above, this is a good camping spot.</p>

<p>Much like in Afghan, at the beginning for Spetsnaz, a good but heavily frowned upon technique is with a grenade launcher run to start firing grenades down towards the Task Force 141 below or using a sniper, it is an excellent way to get quick kills at the beginning of a match.</p>

<p>If playing Search and Destroy, and defending the bomb site in the house, you can hide underneath the stairs but can be flanked and killed from behind.</p>

<p>A thermal scope is a good idea because it's very easy for enemies to blend into their surroundings. A good idea would be to use a class with a Cold-Blooded perk.</p>

<p>When sniping remember to relocate often. As always, a good player using defensive skills will seek out and eliminate the target if one has not moved, or is camping.</p>

<p>A great spot to call in a care package is behind the greenhouse, the player should not do this if his/her team does not have control over the main house.</p>

<p>Another good spot to call in a care package is on the edge of the map where the electrical lines and the tower are. This is obvious, but it works. Be cautious, as it may get stuck up above if you don't throw the signal grenade at the right position.</p>

<p>This can be a good map for Commando Pro, as there are many large drops that can be utilized to escape a pursuer or to reach an objective quickly. For example, the cliffs by the estate.</p>

<p>There is a good camping spot beside the house where two walls meet, staying here the player is impossible to spot from behind and from the sides, with a good view of the sunroom of the house, and the greenhouse.</p>

<p>In the main room on the house, it is possible to jump from the indoor balcony onto the horizontal beams on the walls near the side windows, this can be an excellent camping spot.</p>

<p>Another good camping spot to snipe from is on top of the boathouse. The player can climb on the chair round the rear of the building to reach the barrels. From the top most barrel, jump onto the wooden pole opposite and then onto the roof.</p>

<p>Using a pistol with a tactical knife can make one deadly in both the house and the greenhouse.</p>

<p>It is also possible to get on top of the green house from the slanted part of it, while this does leave the player out in the open, it is a good vantage point if one can get up there without being spotted.</p>

<p>The player can walk up a small rut near the creek to the back of the house, completely bypassing the greenhouse, and avoiding any claymores and/or campers in it.</p>

<p>There are several patches of grass along the side of the house, giving a large vantage point of the map, and a nice bit of camouflage.</p>

<p>In the garage where the snowmobile is, when using the upper room there is a walkway leading to the back where the player can plant a claymore to protect the ladder, but the player may be caught in the claymore blast.</p>

<p>The deck on the top is a common sniping spot, placing a sentry gun there just about controls the front of the house.</p>

<p>When sniping in this map, stay in an elevated position. When sniping out of windows, stay back from them so one's body isn't as easily visible and can't be killed from the side of the window. Always look for potential counter sniping spots where an enemy sniper could get a clean shot at the player. When moving in this map be quick and stealthy, while running through open areas zig-zag because odds are an enemy sniper has their crosshairs trained to the player's head.</p>

<p>In the small bathroom there is a very good camping spot. The player must jump on the sink and walk towards the wall away from the door. The player will then randomly go up a little bit, not much, but is good because by placing a claymore in the middle of the doorway, having a good Assault Rifle (or LMG), and then a shotgun (preferably a Striker or Model 1887 w/ Akimbo), it can make a very good camping spot. As in large games people will run by the three areas that the player has control over, and can be good for getting the "None Spared" accolade. A good counter would be to throw grenades in, as its hard to run out of the room fast, and if they throw a frag grenade back out, then the opposing players know that they're inside. A humorous way to counteract multiple enemies that rush in for a shotgun or knife kill would be to grab a shotgun (Model 1887 Akimbo is best), run into the room on the other side of the hall, and then kill the players attempting to rush the player. This is harder on an online match, but is good for getting multi-kills and the "Cruelty" Challenge.</p>

<p>The player can get on top of every roof in Estate except for the main house and the garage across from the house with the red SUV sticking out of it.</p>

<p>The player can climb the railing on the left side of the main house and jump onto the upper balcony, making 3 ways to get upstairs.</p>

<p>A good place to drop a Care Package is at the back underneath the dock.</p>

<p>A free-for-all match with 2 players can turn into a King of the Hill game. This would happen by one player holding the house, while the other player tried to infiltrate it and take the house.</p>

<p>If the player is inside the house, it is a great domination point, but also becomes a main target. It is wise to have at least 2 team members inside the house so one doesn't get surrounded.</p>

<p>A Sentry Gun placed on the upper floor can control the boathouse and anyone is slaughtered trying to advance from the front. This allows more players to defend the back, where flankers will attempt to root the player out.</p>

<p>The Power Station area is one of the best places in all of Estate to call in Emergency Airdrops, Sentry Guns or a Care Package. Most of the action happens at the mansion and the boathouse.</p>

<p>It is possible to get on top of the power station in the northern part of the map, by climbing the ladder to the top of the building next to it, walking along the fence, and jumping to the station. This is a good place to snipe from, as most players are not aware of how to get up there.</p>

<p>A sniper with a woodland ghillie suit can pick one of two great sniping/ambush spots. The first of these spots is to lie prone in the grass on the left side of the boat house, this provides a shot on anyone in that part of the map. Another great spot is hidden in a bush directly across from the main doorway into the house. A silencer is recommended for both of these spots, and playing on Hardcore will make it near impossible to be found.</p>

<p>If in trouble, just run and don't look back until the player is in cover. Snipers can be deadly accurate on this map and extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>To counter those who fire from the windows or openings from the house, use FMJ on a weapon. This can be very useful mainly because most players like to fire from the windows and the player is able to obtain some kills for Extended Magazines.</p>

<p>In Domination, at flag B you can lay down by the snowmobile and aim at the door. This can help you hold it and rack up kills easy.</p>

<p>A well placed Javelin rocket or Predator could wipe out every enemy in the house. A good tactic is crashing one through a sunroof.</p>

<p>A good place to hide while using controlled killstreaks is to hide behind the counter in the basement, The fields in the back, the open but eye tricking the grassy small river fall right of the 1st floor entrance to the green house, and finally the power station and fields in the back of the map. Areas such as inside the house OR under and the boat house are common used places. The player's enemy team might fight and try to take the Cabin in the middle of the map so it is very unreliable. Under or Behind the boathouse is a commonly used area more stealthier players.</p>

<p>A good S&amp;D tactic (Behind the cabin spawn) is to have a Assault rifle and claymores and plant them in the are behind and the 1st floor entrance of the greenhouse. While the player covers the area leading to the side of the cabin (Near where the river ends) by climbing onto the wood stacks and having the height advantage (You might get from a player that reached the cabin's 2nd floor area.</p>

<p>One good camping spot is on the roof of the boating house by the lake, it overlooks a pretty decent area of the map. However, this roof doesn't give you much cover, so most of the time just stay prone and don't crouch a lot.</p>
