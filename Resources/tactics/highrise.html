<h1>Highrise</h1>

<img src="../images/thumbnails/highrise.png" />

<p>Place: New York City, United States<br />
Teams: US Army Rangers vs. Spetsnaz<br />
Type of Combat: Close to medium range combat, Minor long range combat (Crane and roof of South Building)<br />
Terrain: Construction site surrounded with large office buildings</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Highrise is set atop a nearly constructed skyscraper with two office buildings on opposite sides of the map. Most of the combat on the ground is short to medium range with the construction equipment and in the office buildings. Shotguns and submachine guns are excellent for these offices, but assault rifles are ideal for the sometimes medium-long range combat that occurs in the more open areas. The map is also suitable for sniping, with several vantage points that look over most of, or nearly all of, the map.</p>

<p>A unique feature of this map is its multi-tiered construction; both offices can be accessed by a tunnel underneath, which leads upstairs at various points in between. Near the cranes, there is an elevator shaft with a ladder; behind it is a climbable ledge players can hide behind. Players can access the roof on the South block, and see almost the entire map, although after a few kills these players can easily be taken out and the journey to the roof needs a skillful player that can run and make quick turns on the ledge, while avoiding getting shot. For this reason, a Tactical Insertion is recommended for doing this. Players can climb to the top of the crane at the West side of the map, giving a similar view on the map, and become harder to spot. From that crane, there is access to the ledge above the North tower's office - a Tactical Insertion is also useful here. To get to the North tower, players must climb on to a crane, walk across to the North building, then climb onto one of several window-cleaning platforms and walk across the ledge. There will be a window were Players can crouch under it, there will be a choice if the player wants to go onto the platform (smashing the window) or stay on the ledge.</p>

<p>This map is one of the best places to get the Extended Mags attachment, as there are many good places to kill enemies through cover with FMJ, for example the windows, and office furniture. </p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>From the start, players like to rush forwards and take aim, especially with snipers, to the other side of the map, through the front windows. From there, players can snipe any unaware players rushing forwards through the windows. Thermal Sights can help with this, as well as using powerful assault rifles, especiall in Hardcore.</p>

<p>Spawning in the northern building is disadvantageous. Snipers from the south can kill all of the team, especially devastating in S&amp;D, from the spawn: Sniping directly from the windows at the front, as well as from the cubicles in the middle to the other way enemies can run to at the start.</p>

<p>From either spawn, a ledge is accessible, with help from two window cleaning platforms, at the east edge of the map. This is an effective flank route, especially in search and destroy, where it can be used to take a team from behind.</p>

<p>The stairs on the helipad offer a view through the gap between the actual helipad and the building in which it is situated on. Players can effectively kill players as they spawn as enemies can do little to prevent this.</p>

<p>In the southern building there is a skylight feature in the roof. This can be used to call in care packages, as well as fire a javelin through. It can also be an area to aim a javelin from outside. This is useful if enemies are camping in their spawn in Search and Destroy, which is common.</p>

<h2>Useful Areas</h2>

<p>Highrise is a map famous among players for its many secret areas which are favored by snipers especially, although are used by players using Assault Rifles, especially the long-range rifles such as the M16A4 or SCAR-H.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous is the "roof glitch" in which players are able to access the roof of the southern office building. This is the U.S. Army Rangers Spawn on Team Deathmatch, and the Attacking side on Search and Destroy. To do so, players must jump from the edge of the building on the east side, and land on a hanging window-cleaning platform which serves as a ladder. They then must proceed to walk along the ledge and jump onto another window cleaning platform and then finally up to a ledge which gives access to the roof. This "glitch" is commonly utilised by players playing Hardcore Team Deathmatch or Headquarters as there is a lack of killcam which means they are less likely to be quickly found out. Using Smoke Grenades can assist in getting to the top, but many players are aware of it and do their best to stop players from getting there. To counter players that are sniping from the roof, going on top of the crane gives an elevated position from which to kill them.</p>

<p>The Crane on the west side of the map features many areas which also favours sniping. Players can jump onto the beams from the crane off the elevator roof, and then jump to the crane. From there, there are two areas which are accessible. The most common is probably the top of the crane itself. This offers a vantage point over most of the map, bar the underground and further into offices. If the player on top knows where the enemy are respawning, they can position themselves for protection by crouching on either side of the metal. Another area accessible from the crane is a small ledge in the northern tower. It runs across the front, and features several windows and another window-cleaning platform which can be accessed, which looks over the B objective in Search and Destroy. To get here, players must move along the crane toward the tower and jump onto a small ledge, then to a platform, then through a small window.</p>

<p>In the northern tower, a stepladder can be found which offers access to the lighting fixtures above the bar. This can be used to help protect the B flag, which is an influential point, in Domination. It is also a useful place to call in controllable killstreaks as players are unlikely to be found.</p>
