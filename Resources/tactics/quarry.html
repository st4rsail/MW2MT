<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The map is located at a large rock quarry somewhere in Brazil, indicated by the Brazilian flag shown on one of the buildings. It has excellent sniping positions located all over the map, however most have become well known and even the most experienced snipers will find difficulty in surviving in one spot after neutralizing several enemies. The map also features buildings and pathways allowing for good close-range combat. This map is excellent for all types of weapons, with sniper and assault rifles making use of the long ranges and camping spots, and SMG/shotgun  runners making use of the small pathways in between and around the rocks.</p>

<p>In some places players are able to climb up onto the rocks themselves, and make use of the high ground for some excellent sniping positions. Unfortunately, if the Desert Ghillie Suit has not been unlocked, or an Assault Rifle is being used, players are extremely exposed the majority of the time - even the ghillie suit can stand out against the rock as well, in places. Furthermore, there are numerous amounts of camping and hiding spots inside all the buildings at the top of the quarry, such as several ladders reaching the top of one of them, players can go prone and neutralize targets entering the building. However, sniping spots, such as the one on the top gantry in the large warehouse, have become notorious, so many players will check them out for snipers before rushing out. </p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Assault Rifles, due to their versatility, are the most common weapons used on this map, as there are areas of long range, as well as close range, where rifles such as the TAR-21  are very useful. SMGs are less used as there are many long sightlines where the lack of power and higher recoil will often result in enemies still surviving, and possibly cause the user to be killed. Sniper Rifles are also commonly used, as there are many areas where a sniper can control easily due to long sightlines and abundance of camouflage and elevated positions.</p>

<p>Moving through the loading bay and Warehouse through to the offices, players using SMGs can easily control the area. Claymores coupled with Scavenger are very useful for protection, as well as obtaining killstreaks. Picking enemies off at distance with an assault rifle or sniper rifle is also a viable option, especially in team games where backup players can help defend the flanks. Elevated areas used by these marksmen are often watched or targeted by recently-killed enemies, so it is advisable to not use common areas such as the gantry at the highest point of the warehouse. However, on the gantry, players can stand atop the rails and take out enemies flanking by the tank garage or the red barrel area.</p>

<p>Commando Pro is by far one of the most useful perks for the map, as there are many drops which will kill players using other tier 3 perks. It can be very useful for Rushing or sniping, when elevated positions are compromised by enemies, and Commando Pro is vital for escape. Scavenger, as stated above is useful for replenishing equipment such as claymores when defending buildings. Marathon, coupled with Lightweight, is a useful perk for flanking, and taking out players camping in the warehouses.</p>

<p>UAVs as always, are one of the most useful killstreaks to use, as it is vital to know which area enemies are spawning in, which in turn will help the team defend areas. The Pave Low is a potent killstreak which gains many kills, as a lot of Quarry is open areas, and indoor areas often are warehouses with large doors which the helicopter will shoot through. In team games, AC-130s are usually better than Chopper Gunners, as the Apache is less useful for shooting in large open space.</p>

<p>The area atop the hill containing explosive red barrels is often where many players first go to in TDMs. Throwing stuns from a distance will cause these to explode and kill any rushers running through, or those waiting to get a few early kills. Domination flag B can be captured while standing on the ladder; this is used by experienced players to avoid being killed by the wave of explosives which usually follows after the announcement of a flag being captured.</p>
