<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This map is a medium sized urban map. The map offers an excellent balance of open area combat, combined with building and rooftop battling.</p>

<p>One of the map's main advantages for players is the variation of levels, these different heights offer players the ability to use most of the guns. The small corridors of the buildings benefit shotgun and SMG users where a quick fire rate would be ideal. The rooftop locations and upper floor windows benefits players who use sniper rifles, assault rifles and LMGs as their extended range and damage can be utilized.</p>

<p>The nature of this map isn't friendly to players who use the higher Kill streaks. The ability to go into buildings can render the Predator Missile, Precision Airstrike, Harrier Airstrike, Attack Helicopter, Pave Low, Stealth Bomber, Chopper Gunner and AC130 Kill Streak rewards useless. Although they can still get kills as there are large open areas, rooftops and outdoor spawns, players should not expect to get 10 kills per streak every time. </p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

 <p>The best places to call in a Care Package is the far back of the SEAL spawn, as there is only one way into that area, and the far back of the OpFor spawn near the school, as it is rare for players to enter these areas. The same goes for Emergency Airdrops, but it is ill-advised since there are many buildings with non-accessible rooftops as well as the edges of the level surrounding these areas.</p>

<p>Chopper Gunner does not work very well on this map, only if you are catching the enemy spawn will it work good as approx. 70% of this map is indoors. An AC-130 will be more effective but can still have difficulty if all enemies are hiding inside buildings. If they are, the player's teammates can throw a grenade to wipe them out and the AC-130 operator can begin decimating.</p>

<p>Rooftop camping is an easy way to complete the Prone Shot challenges.</p>

<p>Near the SEALS spawn, there is a ladder the player can climb up to a roof. To the right, it gives the player a large portion of open space to snipe.</p>

<p>In Domination, the player can set up a Sentry Gun to watch site B. At a high vantage point, it is relatively unnoticed and can get quite a few kills.</p>

<p>The player can view enemy names through the bus when prone, this is especially useful in Search and Destroy.</p>

<p>A smoke grenade can virtually conceal a bomb planter from enemy eyes without thermal scopes for at least 30 seconds. Grenades will still remain a problem unless thrown on the other side of the bomb planter.</p>

<p>When playing Domination, if the player is on the SEAL's team, the player could rush the OpFor team with a rushing class with Marathon and Lightweight at flag A. Most of the time the player could throw in a grenade/semtex, or fire a rocket at A - this can get the player any number of kills. Making multi-kills at the start is very possible and very likely. Alternatively, Danger Close could be used to boost the explosive damage of the player's explosive armanents.</p>

<p>Although it seems an obvious spot, the blown-out building near the B flag in Domination can be a highly effective method of suppressing an entire enemy team in Hardcore Ricochet:HQ Pro, especially if their spawn point is in the eastern side of the map. Using a silenced sniper rifle, such as the M14 EBR(labeled M21 EBR in Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer), can rack up large killstreaks easily, with the only threat being a quick flanker armed with a grenade. The room is surprisingly easy to defend.</p>

<p>Maintaining the higher ground will give the player an upper hand, but there are many ways up, jeopardizing the player's control.</p>
